# Markup Monitor

Markup Monitor is a web app that provides a live preview of markdown content. It allows users to input markdown text and instantly see the formatted output. This tool is helpful for users who want to visualize how their markdown content will appear before publishing.

## Features

- **Markdown input**: Users can enter their markdown content in a text editor.
- **Live preview**: A real-time preview of the formatted output is displayed as users type or make changes to the markdown text.
- **Markdown syntax highlighting**: Syntax highlighting is applied to the markdown text for better readability.
- **Rendered output**: The final rendered version of the markdown content is shown, allowing users to see the exact appearance.
- **Customization options**: Users can choose different themes or styles for the rendered output.
- **Export functionality**: Users can export the rendered output as HTML or download it as a file.
- **Error handling**: Syntax errors or issues with the markdown content are identified and notified to users.
